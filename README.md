# Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component

This project marks my second venture on Frontend Mentor, tackling the Results Summary Component. The main goal was to faithfully replicate the provided design while incorporating Sass, a technology I am currently learning. Please note that this project remains static, and I did not implement the bonus dynamic JSON data or JavaScript functionality.
